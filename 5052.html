                <h1>5052</h1>
                <p>Be was a very curious boy who loved to explore the world.<br>He always wanted to learn new things and have fun. One day, he found a big yellow flower in his backyard. He decided to take a closer look and see what was inside.<br>

                    As he approached the flower, he heard a buzzing sound. He peeked inside and saw a tiny bee flying around. The bee noticed him and flew out of the flower.<br>
                    
                    "Hello, who are you?" the bee asked.<br>
                    
                    "I'm Be, and you?" Be replied.<br>
                    
                    "I'm Bee, nice to meet you," the bee said.<br>
                    
                    "Wow, you have the same name as me, but with an extra e," Be exclaimed.<br>
                    
                    "That's right, we do. Do you know what that means?" Bee asked.<br>
                    
                    "No, what does it mean?" Be wondered.<br>
                    
                    "It means that we are different but also the same. We are both living things that can move and talk and feel. But we also have different shapes and sizes and abilities. You are a human and I am an insect. You can walk and run and jump. I can fly and sting and make honey. You use the verb to be to describe yourself and others. I use the verb to bee to describe myself and others," Bee explained.<br>
                    
                    "Wow, that's amazing. I never knew that there was a verb to bee. Can you teach me how to use it?" Be asked.<br>
                    
                    "Sure, I can. It's very easy. You just add an e to the end of the verb to be. For example, instead of saying 'I am happy', you say 'I am happye'. Instead of saying 'You are smart', you say 'You are smarte'. Instead of saying 'He is brave', you say 'He is bravee'. And so on," Bee said.<br>
                    
                    "Wow, that's so cool. Can I try it?" Be said.<br>
                    
                    "Of course, you can. Go ahead," Bee encouraged him.<br>
                    
                    "OK, let me see. I am happye because I met you. You are smarte because you know a lot of things. He is bravee because he is not afraid of anything. She is prettye because she has beautiful wings. It is sunnye because the sun is shining bright. We are friendse because we like each other. They are busye because they have a lot of work to do," Be said.<br>
                    
                    "Very good, Be. You are a fast learner," Bee complimented him.<br>
                    
                    "Thank you, Bee. You are a great teacher," Be thanked him.<br>
                    
                    "You're welcome, Be. You are a kind student," Bee said.<br>                   
                    They smiled at each other and hugged. They became the best of friends and had many adventures together. They learned from each other and had fun with each other.<br>They used the verb to be and the verb to bee to express themselves and their feelings.<br>They were happye.</p>
