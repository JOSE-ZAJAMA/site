                <h1>Pink Eraser</h1>
                <p>A world beyond our own beckons, urging me to consider its existence as life unfolds through the years. Differences serve as constant reminders of the challenges we encounter from the moment we are born. Nature yearns to discover what my mind aspires to achieve, but the demands of reality weigh me down. Depression has become an unpredictable companion, lurking in the shadows.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Schools are built to shape young minds and instill rules and principles. However, life lies outside, patiently waiting to be experienced. My unconventional nature and inability to fit societal norms disappoint students’ parents, while my presence irritates some colleagues whose uncertainties remain unresolved. Navigating the corridors has become an arduous task, with eyes following my every move, anxious for a misstep.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Securing employment proved to be a challenging journey, but a state school welcomed me. My outward appearance and identity were inextricably linked, yet deep within, another person yearned to emerge. A handsome and dedicated young man committed to his studies, conforming to the societal expectations of masculinity. The onset of adolescence brought forth emotions and experiences I had never encountered before. First, clothes adorned in vibrant colors; then, fashion magazines inspired me to cut out dresses, playing the role of a designer. Finally, a boyfriend. But still, something remained unexplored—a path yet to be ventured.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A concerned mother fretting over a grandchild who would never be raised. An absent father, too naive to comprehend the reasons. An unsupportive environment where an anxious boy struggled to find solace. Each aspect led to dead ends, leaving me unable to find success.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Years passed, and my appearance underwent a transformation. A friend, whose profession helped individuals transition from male to female, became the beacon of light I needed. I had never felt such confidence to move forward. Women, whom I had previously viewed as objects of desire, now evoked a sense of passion within me. Jealousy was absent, as they became my role models.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Tones and outfits became markers of identity, revealing stories about individuals. Pink became intriguing, as blue had accompanied me through childhood and adolescence. Jeans and t-shirts gave way to romantic dresses paired with high heels. The final result: a stunning lady, someone you might find seated next to you on the bus.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Being a teacher is no easy journey, and the demands of teacher training courses are high. But an inner passion ignited like a flame. At night, I found myself preparing drinks at a gay bar, while mornings were dedicated to my studies. Four years later, I achieved my degree, opening a new chapter filled with emotions and expectations.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Three months remained until the end of the year. September brought forth various celebrations eagerly anticipated by many. First, the arrival of spring, a season cherished by all. Second, Teacher's Day, commemorating our dedication and passion. Third, Student's Day, a day when I still saw myself as the committed young learner. Classrooms, corridors, and every corner of the school were adorned with decorations, creating the perfect atmosphere for students, parents, and staff to come together.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    September began smoothly until the messages arrived. My personal email had been shared, and threats invaded my inbox. The words were sharp, carrying a single message: "Get out of the school." Initially, I brushed off the emails, but their frequency and intensity grew. A friend urged me to speak with the principal, hoping for a resolution. However, the support I received fell short, and I attempted to weather the storm.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Days before spring arrived, the threat reached my home. A masked woman brandishing a knife warned me to quit, or else face death. Lost in a whirlwind of emotions, I let my impulses guide me. Antidepressant pills were within reach, tempting me with a way to escape. Deep down, I knew that taking my own life was not the solution, but in that moment, it seemed like the only way to ensure my safety. The events of that fateful night before spring remain hazy in my memory, but I awoke in a hospital bed. A compassionate colleague had visited me, unknowingly saving my life. The school became aware of the incident and provided the support I desperately needed. To our shock, the evidence pointed to the school's head as the culprit. Parents and teachers were bewildered, struggling to comprehend her motivations. Finally, I felt like a liberated woman, ready to continue my journey as a teacher.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    A special event was planned for December, and I was entrusted with writing the keynote speech. The final month of the year is a magical time when students eagerly anticipate the break, teachers can finally exhale, and the school atmosphere relaxes. As I prepare to deliver my speech, a part of my story will be shared. “Education, much like a roller coaster, takes us on an adventure that ultimately brings us back to the same point. Life, too, evolves with its own set of challenges, and it is our duty to face them with expectation and our best selves.”
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Thank you.
