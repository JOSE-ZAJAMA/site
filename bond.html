                <h1>Our Bond</h1>
                <p>She always rides her bicycle along the path of my house. I wake up and I go to the entrance in order to wait for her. When she arrives, I bark at her or bite the wheel of the bike. I don't consider her a threat, as a playful dog I'm happy to see someone taking my street. This recurrent situation rarely annoys her. She is glad about our meeting; I notice it when she returns with a smile of approval. One day I waited a long time for her but she didn't appear. I’m allowed to stay outside for the sake of guarding my owners’ house. That day I challenged their authority and left the house. I was worried because breaking the rules was not part of my normal behaviour. However, I knew I had to follow my instinct. I sniffed out at the grass; her aroma still remained through the air. It was as if she had been coming but suddenly changed her way. There were also two new masculine scents, was she accompanied by them?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I walked miles from my house. Finding her stimulated my movements. I crossed over great distances. I saw beautiful houses, whereas others were fancy. Few dogs approached, they were waving their tails, and some of them were detached. I had an encounter where I revealed my teeth to survive. On a metal post someone hung her photo, was she famous?
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My search led me to a location where rats surrounded it. I got frightened and very insecure. Why did she come here? Why didn’t she find a better place to hide from me? I kept sniffing the surfaces. I was about to quit when I recognised her smell and another, especially a strong one. A kind of mature male, could it be her father or someone she knew? I was not sure, I stayed alert. My heart palpitated in my chest, they weren’t her relatives, and they were totally evil.  
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I neared a house and I identified the same guys I’d already smelled. They seemed exhausted from doing something that required physical exercise. I found my friend’s footsteps. I followed them until a little cottage at the back of the property. It was rather old, no paint, and not beautiful at all. Her bike was next to a window. I tried to peer, black windows made it impossible. I found a medium size hollow at the base of the cottage, my muzzle got in. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I identified her perfume; she seemed to be in there. I wasn't sure to bark, what if someone could hear me? I had to be cautious. I started to cry softly to call her attention. I received an immediate response; she stamped her feet on the floor.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I examined the small residence; it was too vintage and deteriorated. I used my teeth to chew on the wood, it tasted disgusting. I didn’t mind, I had to rescue her. Some minutes later, I realized my body could fit in and get me inside.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The interior was dark but my eyes helped me see along. Her hands, legs and body were tied up to a chair. Concerning her head, she had a bag on it. I pulled the bag but she had a piece of cloth over her mouth. She wept after seeing me; she had bruises over her face. She attempted to move, but her efforts failed. I decided to untie the ropes by chewing them. She released her body and cuddled me. She kissed my head, and my emotions couldn’t help that I barked loudly. She closed my mouth because someone could hear us. Somebody was coming along, she placed me in a corner and she stood up next to the door carrying a bat. Was she playing? She was focusing upon the entrance and I stayed where she put me. Somebody entered; she hit the stranger and cooperated with her plan. I bit the man; I was pissed off with him because he had kidnapped my friend. Then, she dragged my collar and picked up her bicycle. We were running when she fell down on the street. She looked pale and weak. If I barked, the bad ones would find us. I knew we needed help. I woofed! I did it until some appeared. A person pulled over her car. I thought she was one of the kidnappers but she was friendly. She made a call; my aim was to protect them in case the men would emerge.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After that, another car arrived with lights on it. We were carried by the vehicle; it was making a constant noise. One person checked my collar and wrote down something on a piece of paper. We got to another point, so clean and illuminated. Like the one mummy takes me when I’m sick. It was a site for humans where they obtain assistance. A doctor examined my body in order to heal minor injuries, and then he offered me some water and food. I was tired and they showed me a spot to snooze. I was holding the fort that I barely closed my eyes.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The following day a woman guided me into a room. When I entered the room, my owners and other people had been waiting for me. All greeted me with an enthusiastic round of applause. I saw my friend in bed, I climbed up to the bed, I wanted to be near her. I barked in a loud voice, she joined me in barking. She and I were greatly relieved.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One week later, I’m still outside waiting for her. She grins with delight when I go towards her. We have some fun. She gets emotional, and I'm happy to see her again. She gives me a big cuddle and I lick her cheeks. She continues walking along the path. I woof so as to say goodbye. Tomorrow she’ll cross my entrance. The one I decided to leave in order to save the life of my friend.
